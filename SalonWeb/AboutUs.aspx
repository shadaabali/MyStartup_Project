All the Salon Owners are relying on their Customers; who visits Salons to fulfill their own beauty needs. Therefore it is important to value the loyalty and the time of those Customers. From the other side, to make the Salon services better and to enhance the good names of the salons, their Stylist’s/Employee’s satisfaction also needs to be fulfilled. Not only that the income earns by selling services to the clients should be able to monitor by the salon owners. Using manual procedures may pave the way for a variety of obstacles when satisfying Customers and Employees of the respective Salons. Valuable time and money of the Salon Owners, Employees and Customers get waste unnecessarily due to these manual 
                dealings. These barriers make direct harms for the incomes and the good names of the Salons and for their Owners.</td>
